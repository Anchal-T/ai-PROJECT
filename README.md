# Create and solve VRP instance
solver = GraphNeighborhoodSearch(n_nodes=20, k=5)
solver.generate_random_problem()
solver.greedy_vrp_solve()

# Create scheduling instance
scheduler = AerialScheduling(num_vehicles=5, num_tasks=10)
graph_data = scheduler.get_graph_data()

# Initialize GENIS-RL agent
agent = SimpleGENISAgent(num_actions=4)
```
